#employeemanagementsystem

# It is a simple Employee Management System
where you can Add, Delete, Update or Search your employee's details. Since not many routes were there. Hence I have put it in controller.js with the database parameters.

To Run on your system

1. Clone the project
2. Open the cmd and cd to the cloned folder's path and run npm install.
3. type nodemon.
4. Now open your browser and type localhost:3000
